Homework # 1 : Variables
What's your Favorite Song
"""
#Details:
#What's your favorite song?
#Think of all the attributes that you could use to describe that song. That is: all of it's details or "meta-data". 
#These are attributes like "Artist", "Year Released", "Genre", "Duration", etc. Think of as many different characteristics as you can.
#List all of the attributes of the song, one after another, by creating variables for each attribute, and giving each variable a value.
#For extra credit, add comments to your code, that explain the different attributes.
#Also add a title to the top of your file explaining what the file is, and what it's for.
